%
%   - genuine report based on ``report'' style, i.e., with chapters, much like

%
%   - report based on ``article'' style, i.e., with no chapters (only sections,
%     subsections, etc.), much like a journal or conference paper; can be
%     single- or double-sided.

The efficiency of HVAC (Heating Ventilation \& Air Conditioning) systems can be improved by making them
adaptive to the number of people in a room. Automatic adjustments to room ventilation and temperature based on 
room occupancy reduces energy use and is more cost efficient.
In order to a estimate a room's occupancy level, the Occusense Senior Design team has created
a reliable, thermal sensor system to capture the motion of people through doorways. We aim to develop
a reliable, real-time algorithm to detect the direction of motion of people passing through in order to track 
the number of people in the room.

\section{Introduction}  % Article style
%\chapter{Introduction}  % Report style
In modern efficient buildings, controlling the HVAC system preemptively can be a huge cost saver. Therefore, a senior design team at Boston University is working towards developing sensing technology and algorithms to count the number of people in a room so that the system is always conscious of room occupancy and can adjust system parameters, such as ventilation, accordingly before feedback sensing technology can detect abnormalities, such as rising temperatures of a crowded room. There are a number of ways to detect occupancy. However, this project assumes that if a room has a low number of entry points, counting people can be done at the entries based on who is entering or leaving the room. As such, there would be a continuous knowledge of the number of people in a room. The senior design team has implemented a privacy-inclined low resolution thermal sensor with a field of view of 30°x120° positioned at the top of the door frame and looking perpendicularly down. It is capable of capturing a 16x4 pixel array at frame rates of 0.5 to 512 Hz. Using this information, our project is tasked at developing algorithms to count the number of people entering or leaving a room. Specifically, this algorithm will
1) detect the presence of a moving person in the frame and 2) determine the direction of motion.

Here comes the introduction and reference to a paper \cite{Mchugh09}.
